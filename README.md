Hi, my names Jack Jennings and I am a young,
and interested learner of the Python language.
I am currently learning the language as I want to 
go into a Python based job when I am older.
I have a gig set up on fiverr where I will 
go on a zoom call with you, and teach
you everything I know about Python and how to solve 
projects which will make you understand the language even better. 
You can find the link here:

I will go through everything clearly and I will 
share all the knowledge I have gathered depending 
on what package you choose :)
You can contact me through my Email:

Jackjennings2005@gmail.com
And I will be more than happy for you to message me 
Though Instagram direct messages :)

@the_real_jack.jenningsss 
Where I will get back to you as soon as possible when I have time :)
